## 2. String Method
  1. Things to remember  
    - String is immutable.  
    - When it is referring type, it checks out whether it occupies the same memory space.  
    - When it is declared through 'new' operator, it does not refer from constant pool unconditionally.  
    - It will be started in the Heap section. 
 
  2. Examples
```java
package Prgrs.Class.String;

public class StringEx {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "Hello";
        // String str2 = "Hello";

        // String str3 = new String("FastCampus");

        System.out.println(str1.length());
        System.out.println(str1.concat(" LOSERS"));
        System.out.println(str1.substring(1, 3));
        System.out.println(str1.substring(2));
    }
}
```
