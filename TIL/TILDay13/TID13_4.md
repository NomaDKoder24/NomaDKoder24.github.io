## Content
  1. Practicing Git add, commit and push with Terminal  
```shell script
Designating the location of files that is going to be uploaded in my git.
I used git status frequently as the teacher instructed yesterday. 
I used all the commands like git add, commit, push, etc. However, I failed
to push these files in terminal. 

I would love to fix this problem because it is the fundamental matter but 
I have to focus on the main subject as of now because the more topics come
the more I cannot catch thse up. 

Therefore, I promise that I will fix this problem when I am stabilized with 
our class.
