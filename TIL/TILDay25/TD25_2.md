#### Ep.48 More on Methods and A Challenge
I felt I could solve this however I could not fully understand the instruction from the teacher. So I could not continue the problem. 

When I check the solution with him, I felt what I've thought was quite close to the solution however I had a problem understanding the instruction so I was not clear how I will code. 

I will try it again after few days.

```java
package sec4.ep048C;

/**
 * Create a method called displayHighScorePosition
 * it should a players name as a parameter, and a 2nd parameter as a position in the high score table
 * You should display the players name along with a message like " managed to get into position" and
 * the position they got and a further message " on the high score table".
 *
 * Create a 2nd method called calculateHighScorePosition
 * it should be sent one argument only, the player score
 * it should return an int
 * the return data should be
 * 1 if the score is >=1000
 * 2 if the score is >=500 and < 1000
 * 3 if the score is >=100 and < 500
 * 4 in all other cases
 * call both methods and display the results of the following
 * a score of 1500, 900, 400 and 50

        String player, position;
