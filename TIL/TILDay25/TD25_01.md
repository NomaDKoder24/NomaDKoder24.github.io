#### Ep.47 Methods in Java

This episode showed the importance and flexible approach on the method. 

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean gameOver = true;
        int score = 800;
        int levelCompleted = 5;
        int bonus = 100;

        int highScore = calculateScore(gameOver, score, levelCompleted, bonus);
        System.out.println("Your final score was " + highScore);
				
				// int keyword was already used for the same variable. (Flexible)
				highScore = calculateScore(gameOver, score, levelCompleted, bonus); 
        System.out.println("Your final score was " + highScore);

    public static int calculateScore(boolean gameOver, int score, int levelCompleted, int bonus) { // parameter

        if (gameOver) {
            int finalScore = score + (levelCompleted * bonus);
            finalScore += 1000;
            return finalScore;
        }

        return -1; 
```

Another Case

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean gameOver = true;
        int score = 800;
        int levelCompleted = 5;
        int bonus = 100;

        calculateScore(true, 800, 5, 100); // arguments

        score = 10000;
        levelCompleted = 8;
        bonus = 200;
        calculateScore(gameOver, score, levelCompleted, bonus);

        if(gameOver) {
            int finalScore = score + (levelCompleted * bonus);
            System.out.println("Your final score was " + finalScore);
        }
    }
		/*
     * When you're creating a method,
     * and you're defining parameters of a certain type and a name,
     * don't have to create them in the method at all.
     * you can even delete these.
     *
     *  boolean gameOver = true;
     *  int score = 800;
     *  int levelCompleted = 5;
     *  int bonus = 100;
     *
     * what actually happens is if you define these parameters, Java will automatically
     * create variables with the appropriate data type for us.
     */

public static int calculateScore(boolean gameOver, int score, int levelCompleted, int bonus) { // parameter
//        boolean gameOver = true;
//        int score = 800;
//        int levelCompleted = 5;
//        int bonus = 100;

        if (gameOver) {
            int finalScore = score + (levelCompleted * bonus);
            finalScore += 1000;
            return finalScore;
        }

        return -1;
				// how does it work by return '-1'? what about 1? what about thousands?
        // when I tried it out, it only shows that the method did not work.
        // then, is there any meaning putting numbers overthere...??

        // According to buddy, -1 is being used for something went wrong.
        // In this code, it won't return -1 unless it is false.
        // Simply, we can think of what we can feel about positive and negative meaning.
        // That's why '-1' was used and it's as simple as that.
    }
}
